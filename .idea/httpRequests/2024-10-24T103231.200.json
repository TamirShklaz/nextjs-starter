It will read and write to files in your project to produce the code you want.\r\n\r\nManicode is different from all the other coding agents, we swear!\r\n\r\nWhy it's cool:\r\n- **It chooses files to read automatically on each message** — unlike Cursor’s composer feature. This saves you time and makes Manicode respond more comprehensively.\r\n- **It takes 0 clicks** — type your instructions and Manicode will edit your files directly. It's simple and fast. Theoretically, you can do all your development by just chatting with it!\r\n- **It has full access to your terminal** — Manicode can run terminal commands to install packages, run tests, check for type errors, etc. Manicode is an engineer working for you.",

This ensures no calls or leads are missed, boosting both customer satisfaction and team efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe car dealership industry handles over 3 billion calls annually, with each call averaging 4 to 6 minutes. Traditional call centers charge between $1 and $2 per minute, depending on the complexity of the service. Thus, we estimate the total addressable market for inbound calls alone to exceed $26 billion a year. This does not even account for future opportunities in outbound calls.\r\n\r\nBefore launching Sandra, the founding team spent years working in the automotive and call center industries during their time at McKinsey. The three co-founders graduated in Data Science and AI from institutions like MIT, Ecole Polytechnique and HEC Paris.\r\n",
